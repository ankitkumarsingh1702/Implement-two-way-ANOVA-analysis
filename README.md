## üìñ **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Data Analytics Assignment-3** repository! This project focuses on identifying genes that respond differently to smoking in men versus women. By employing a two-way ANOVA framework, we analyze the interaction between **Smoking Status** and **Gender** to uncover significant genes influencing this differential response.

---

## üîç **Problem Statement**

**Objective:**  
Identify genes that exhibit differential responses to smoking based on gender by performing a two-way ANOVA analysis.

**Tasks:**

1. **Two-way ANOVA:**  
   Utilize the two-way ANOVA framework to generate p-values for each gene across different groups.
   
2. **P-Value Distribution:**  
   Visualize the distribution of these p-values using a histogram to assess significance across genes.
   
3. **Multiple Testing Correction (Extra Effort):**  
   Apply False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to account for multiple comparisons.
   
4. **Gene Shortlisting:**  
   Shortlist significant genes based on an FDR cut-off of 0.05.
   
5. **Intersection with Gene Lists:**  
   Intersect the shortlisted genes with predefined biological gene lists to understand their roles in specific biological functions.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology**

### 1. Two-way ANOVA

- **Purpose:**  
  Assess the interaction effect between **Smoking Status** and **Gender** on gene expression levels.
  
- **Process:**
  - Iterate over each gene (41,093 rows).
  - Fit a two-way ANOVA model considering both main effects and their interaction.
  - Extract p-values for the interaction term.

### 2. P-Value Distribution

- **Visualization:**  
  - Generate a histogram of all interaction p-values to visualize their distribution.
  
- **Interpretation:**  
  - A uniform distribution indicates no significant effects.
  - An excess of low p-values suggests potential significant interactions.

### 3. Multiple Testing Correction

- **Challenge:**  
  Conducting multiple statistical tests increases the risk of false positives.
  
- **Solution:**  
  - Apply the **Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR)** correction.
  - Control the expected proportion of false discoveries among the rejected hypotheses.

### 4. Gene Shortlisting and Intersection

- **Shortlisting:**  
  - Select genes with adjusted p-values (FDR) below 0.05.
  
- **Intersection with Gene Lists:**  
  - **Predefined Gene Lists:**
    - Xenobiotic Metabolism
    - Free Radical Response
    - DNA Repair
    - Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxicity
  - **Objective:**  
    - Determine overlap between significant genes and these biological functions.
  
- **Further Analysis:**  
  - Split intersection counts based on upregulation and downregulation in:
    - Women Smokers vs. Non-Smokers
    - Men Smokers vs. Non-Smokers
