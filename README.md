Implement two-way ANOVA analysis and gene shortlist

- Performed two-way ANOVA to generate p-values for each gene
- Plotted histogram of p-value distribution
- Applied FDR correction with a cutoff of 0.05 to identify significant genes
- Created a shortlist of gene symbols from significant rows
- Intersected shortlisted genes with predefined lists:
  • Xenobiotic metabolism
  • Free Radical Response
  • DNA Repair
  • Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxicity
- Reported intersection counts for each gene list, segmented by gender and smoking status
